# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

## Description
This project is part of the ALX System Engineering & DevOps curriculum.  
It covers shell initialization files, variables, expansions, and creating executable scripts in Bash.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What happens when you type `$ ls -l *.txt`
- How to create, update, and list environment variables
- The difference between local and global variables
- What a reserved variable is
- How to print the value of a variable
- How to set a new variable
- How to export a variable to the environment
- How to use the `alias` command
- How to perform arithmetic operations in the shell

## Requirements
- All scripts must be executable
- The first line of each script should be `#!/bin/bash`
- All scripts should end with a new line
- You should not use `awk`, `perl`, or any other programming language
- Files should be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
